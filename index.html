<p>What does it mean if a woman is inferior to men?<br>
➼ First of all, this is a thing which is called gender stereotyping.<br>
So if you’re asking what gender stereotyping is, Gender stereotyping is<br>
the practice of ascribing to an individual woman or man specific attributes,<br>
characteristics, or roles by reason only of her or his membership in the<br>
social group of women or men. With that out of  the way, let's go back to<br>
the first question. If a woman is inferior to men what does it mean?<br>
It means that men are more superior and there's no balance in gender.

    <h3> What is the mayan civilization? </h3>
<P> ➼ The Maya civilization was a Mesoamerican civilization developed by<br>
    the Maya peoples, and noted for its logosyllabic way the most sophisticated<br>
    and highly developed writing system in pre-Columbian Americas as well<br>
    as for its art, architecture, mathematics, calendar, and astronomical system.<br> 
    The Maya civilization developed in the area that today comprises southeastern Mexico,<br>
    all of Guatemala and Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador.<br>
    It includes the northern lowlands of the Yucatan Peninsula and the highlands<br>
    of the Sierra Madre, the Mexican state of Chiapas,southern Guatemala.<br>
    El Salvador, and the southern lowlands of the Pacific littoral plain.<br>
    Maya is a modern term used to refer collectively to the various peoples<br>
    that inhabited this area. They did not call themselve Maya and did not have<br>
    a sense of common identity or political unity.
<br><br>
    ➼ Today their descendants, known collectively as the Maya, number well<br>
    over 6 million individuals, speak more than twenty-eight Mayan surviving Mayan<br>
    languages, and reside in nearly the same area as their ancestor. </p>

<h3>Gender issue</h3>

<P>➼ Our problem is that is that Mayan women are pressured to conform to<br>
    their mother’s viewpoints and opinions and not think independently </p>

<h3>cause</h3>

<p>
    ➼ This rule was made by the ancient mayan politics which influenced a<br>
    lot and caused a big impact on the ancient mayan women. 
</p>

<h3>impact</h3>

<p>
    ➼ This had a big impact on the mayan civilization since women could<br>
    not do anything about it. And only women that were daughters of nobles<br>
    can do something about it since they are the only ones that have power in<br>
    the mayan civilization. 
<br><br>
    ➼ Men can live their normal lives and can pick anything or any path that<br>
    they want to go through, but that is the opposite for ancient mayan women<br>
    since they can only pick a few jobs and sometimes you can even get a job as an ancient mayan woman.
 <br><br>
    ➼ Ancient mayan women were only allowed to stay in their houses and take<br>
    care of children, while men were allowed to go out and get jobs.

</p>

<h3>Our Chosen Solution</h3>

<p>➼make a website where the website Includes the advantages of a civilization that<br> doesn't have a gender stereotype and also help them on their gender issues, by informing them that if there's no gender issues,<br> they will have a  much more better economy, and community, Our target participants or user of our websites are the younger generation since It’s better<br> for young people to be aware of the gender problems in a civilization and know how we can eliminate it and learn the advantages of a civilization without a gender stereotype
</p>

<h3>Is this achievable and effective?</h3>

<P> 
➼This is effective and achievable, Because In our generation It is common for young people to use or be on the internet where they can access our website so in conclusion our solution is pretty achievable now. Is this effective? Yes Because it’s pretty easy to search up or click a link to a website and again in our generation most young people uses the internet and they would probably find time or at least a minute to read and visit our website and also this will not only eliminate gender roles but it could also improve their economy and the relationship between their communities also here are some examples of the advantages of having a civilization with no gender roles: Having less discrimination against other genders, People showing of their skills even if the skill is for a men or a women and there are more advantages.
</p> 

<h3>Proof that our solution is effective and achievable</h3>

<p>
 ➼ According to google There are 4.88billion people who uses the internet in a daily basis<br>
 ➼ It’s easy to click a link and people would probably have time to atleast visit our website<br>
 ➼ If there is no discrimination their community will have better relationships with each other<br>
 ➼ Their economy will be better since there’s not only men who’s doing all the job 
</p>


<h3>conclusion<h3>

<p>
    ➼ So in conclusion we learned that lower women in the mayan civilization did not<br>
    have any good privileges and all they did was stay in their household.<br>
 And only elite mayan women and men can do anything they want. We learn that there is a<br>
big impact on the problem about gender issue because on what<br> happened to mayan girls We learn<br>
that gender Issue is important for people to learn so that It won’t happen again
