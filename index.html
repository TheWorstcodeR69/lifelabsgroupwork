<p>What does it mean if a woman is inferior to men?<br>
➼ First of all, this is a thing which is called gender stereotyping.<br>
So if you’re asking what gender stereotyping is, Gender stereotyping is<br>
the practice of ascribing to an individual woman or man specific attributes,<br>
characteristics, or roles by reason only of her or his membership in the<br>
social group of women or men. With that out of  the way, let's go back to<br>
the first question. If a woman is inferior to men what does it mean?<br>
It means that men are more superior and there's no balance in gender.

    <h3> What is the mayan civilization? </h3>
<P> ➼ The Maya civilization was a Mesoamerican civilization developed by<br>
    the Maya peoples, and noted for its logosyllabic way the most sophisticated<br>
    and highly developed writing system in pre-Columbian Americas as well<br>
    as for its art, architecture, mathematics, calendar, and astronomical system.<br> 
    The Maya civilization developed in the area that today comprises southeastern Mexico,<br>
    all of Guatemala and Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador.<br>
    It includes the northern lowlands of the Yucatan Peninsula and the highlands<br>
    of the Sierra Madre, the Mexican state of Chiapas,southern Guatemala.<br>
    El Salvador, and the southern lowlands of the Pacific littoral plain.<br>
    Maya is a modern term used to refer collectively to the various peoples<br>
    that inhabited this area. They did not call themselve Maya and did not have<br>
    a sense of common identity or political unity.
<br><br>
    ➼ Today their descendants, known collectively as the Maya, number well<br>
    over 6 million individuals, speak more than twenty-eight Mayan surviving Mayan<br>
    languages, and reside in nearly the same area as their ancestor. </p>

<h3>Gender issue</h3>

<P>➼ Our problem is that is that Mayan women are pressured to conform to<br>
    their mother’s viewpoints and opinions and not think independently </p>

<h3>cause</h3>

<p>
    ➼ This rule was made by the ancient mayan politics which influenced a<br>
    lot and caused a big impact on the ancient mayan women. 
</p>

<h3>impact</h3>

<p>
    ➼ This had a big impact on the mayan civilization since women could<br>
    not do anything about it. And only women that were daughters of nobles<br>
    can do something about it since they are the only ones that have power in<br>
    the mayan civilization. 
<br><br>
    ➼ Men can live their normal lives and can pick anything or any path that<br>
    they want to go through, but that is the opposite for ancient mayan women<br>
    since they can only pick a few jobs and sometimes you can even get a job as an ancient mayan woman.
 <br><br>
    ➼ Ancient mayan women were only allowed to stay in their houses and take<br>
    care of children, while men were allowed to go out and get jobs.

</p>

<h3>Our Chosen Solution</h3>

<p>➼ Make a website where the website shows the advantages of a civilization that<br>
    doesn't have a gender stereotype and also help them on their gender issues, by<br>
    telling that if there's no gender issues , there will be much more better economy, and community</p>

<h3>conclusion<h3>

<p>
    ➼ So in conclusion we learned that lower women in the mayan civilization did not<br>
    have any good privileges and all they did was stay in their household.<br>
 And only elite mayan women and men can do anything they want. We learn that there is a<br>
big impact on the problem about gender issue because on what happened to mayan girls We learn<br>
that gender Issue is important for people to learn so that It won’t happen again
